When using the audio manager
- Add an item to the list on the prefab
- Assign a name to the type of sound it is
- Create an empty as a child and add the Audio Source component

To play a main sound
- If the sound is something that is played and is always heard by the player e.g (gunshots, footsteps)
- Use the PlaySound function

To play a distant sound
- If the sound is something that has a drop off e.g when a bullet impacts
- Use the PlayOneShot function

PlaySound(string Name, AudioClip Clip)
- this function will play the input audio clip(Clip) at the assigned audio source(Name)
- if you do not need to change this sound you can also call the overload PlaySound(string Name)

PlayOneShot(Vector3 position, AudioClip clip, float blend)
- this is very similar to the above function only that it will create an AudioSource that will auto destroy after it is done
- the blend(float) value will adjust the amount of 3D spacial audio it has. so 1 is completely 3d and 0 is completely 2d
- 2d = can be heard constantly in ear, 3d = needs to be withing a certain radius to hear.
- more 3d is useful for enemy footsteps or an explosion as you wont always be able to hear them.
